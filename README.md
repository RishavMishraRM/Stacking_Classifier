# Stacking_Classifier

### In this Machine Learning Project we are using several Algorithms to just Check whose accuracy is best and use that algorithm.
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. Neural Net(MLP Classifier)
 
 After there accuracy saving the data to a csv file
